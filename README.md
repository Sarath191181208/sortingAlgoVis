## Description

I am using **functional components & react hooks** to handle the events from the user.
List of Hooks used:

- useState.
- useEffect.
- useCallback.
- useRef.

The Animation is done using [setTimeout](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_settimeout.asp) in a recursive fashion for the animation. In every step of recursion we get the next step of the algorithm.
The algorithm is precomputed for extensibility and is stored in a **Linked list**.
For every recursive call the Linked List is iterated thus showing the animation.

## Features

- A Random button to creates a random board.
- A Clear button to totally clear the board.
- A Start button to start the visualization.
- Sliders to adjust animationn time and number of elements in the array.
